# Sorting Algorithms

## Bubble Sorting

- Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, until the list is sorted.

## Selection Sorting

- Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and unsorted part, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
